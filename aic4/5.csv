5 Information on the General Conditions of the AI Service ;BC-01 System Description ;Information on the General Conditions of the AI service;"In the system description, the AI service pro-
vider sets out precise and comprehensible spec-
ifications regarding the AI service. Goals, design
and application of the AI service are docu-
mented. Policies and guidelines for the provi-
sion of the AI service are outlined.
The system description covers at least the fol-
lowing general aspects:

System specifications for the compati-
bility of AI model(s) within the scope
of the AI service and how it is inte-
grated into general IT systems;

Regulatory and legal requirements as
well as international standards applied
for the AI service itself or related data;

Description of the infrastructure, net-
work and system components used for
development and operation of the AI
service as well as measures taken to en-
sure the integrity of the latter;

Complementary responsibilities of the
user and subservices. "
5 Information on the General Conditions of the AI Service ;BC-02 Security & Robustness;Information on the General Conditions of the Al service;"As part of the system description (BC-01), the AI
service provider states comprehensive infor-
mation allowing a (potential) Al service user to
understand the suitability of robustness and se-
curity measures for the specific Al service.
The information provided covers at least the
following aspects:

Procedure for the measurement and
quantification of robustness;

Level of robustness the Al service pro-
vider guarantees and why it is suffi-
cient for the service at hand;

Limits of the robustness of the Al
model(s) within the scope of the AI ser-
vice."
5 Information on the General Conditions of the AI Service ;BC-03 Performance & Functionality;Information on the General Conditions of the Al service;"As part of the system description (BC-01), the AI
Service provider presents comprehensive in-
formation allowing a (potential) Al service user
to understand and evaluate the suitability of
the performance and functionality for in-
tended use.
The information provided includes at least the
following aspects:

Definition of objectives, impact and
purpose of the Al service;

Procedures and measures imple-
mented to develop and operate the AI
model(s) within the scope of the Al ser-
vice;

Performance measures used to evalu-
ate the Al model(s) within the scope of
the Al service;

Selection of the implemented Al
method (algorithms and data pro-
cessing mechanisms) and an explana-
tion why it is suited for the target ap-
plication. Outline of the limitations
and assumptions of the model;

Training frequency of the AI model(s)
within the scope of the Al service. In-
formation whether it is a continuous
learning system or whether there are
defined learning cycles;

Functionalities of the AI model(s)
within the scope of the Al service. This
includes a description of the task to be
solved and inputs and outputs;

Degree and potential impacts of auto-
mated decision making;

The extent to which users are able to
correct or object to the results or deci-
sions made by the Al service;

Details on significant changes made
during the audit period to procedures,
controls and measures concerning the
Al service. This includes changes made
to the Al model(s) within the scope of
the Al service itself (e.g. retraining,
model change)."
5 Information on the General Conditions of the AI Service ;BC-04 Reliability;Information on the General Conditions of the Al service;"As part of the system description (BC-01), the Al
service provider presents comprehensive in-
formation allowing a (potential) Al service user
to understand and evaluate the reliability of the
Al service, taking the provisioning of resources
and incident handling into account.
The information provided contains at least the
following aspects:

Logging carried out during operation.
This includes an overview of the con-
tent kept in logs as well as storage peri-
ods and usage;

Handling of significant incidents and
conditions that lead to exceptions to
regular operations. This includes a def-
inition of such incidents and condi-
tions as well as implemented safe-
guards and disaster recovery manage-
ment;

Location, duration and responsibilities
for storing and processing involved
data and models."

service provider states comprehensive infor-
mation allowing a (potential) Al service user to
understand and evaluate the suitability of the
data quality and data management for the Al
service.
This information provided covers the follow-
ing aspects:

Description of data sources used for
training and operation of the Al ser-
vice;
